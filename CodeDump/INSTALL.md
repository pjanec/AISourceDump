## **Prerequisites & Setup**

Before using the script, you need to have Python installed on your system and install one third-party library. Using a virtual environment is highly recommended to keep your project dependencies isolated.

### ** Ensure Python is Installed**

This script requires Python 3.9 or newer. You can check your version by opening a terminal or command prompt and running:

`python --version`

### ** Install the Required Library**

The script depends on the `pathspec` library to handle `.gitignore`-style patterns. Install it using pip:

`pip install pathspec`

You are now ready to use the script.
